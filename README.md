# Workshop - Cloud Native Programing with Docker, Kubernetes, and Ballerina

Total time: 120-180 minutes (including slides) depending on whether you type it all or copy from the pre-created script files, how fast you can do it, how many questions you get asked, and so on.

Target audience: technical: workshop, meetups, technical customers/partners - this is a dev-level workshop

# Prep / requirements

## Slide deck

[Ballerina Overview and Demo.pptx](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yuixfusHrICWn6nxRobDEMjuWaHvn3qMJMzQnjNIkMk/edit?usp=sharing)

## Ballerina

Get the latest download from [ballerina.io](http://ballerina.io)

Currently tested on 0.981.0

Add Ballerina **bin** folder to your $PATH

Check it by opening the terminal window and running:

```
$ ballerina version
Ballerina 0.981.0
```

## VS Code

Install VS Code: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Install Ballerina plug in into VS Code by importing the VSIX file:

![image alt text](img/image_0.png)

Make VS Code fonts larger:

* On Windows/Linux - File > Preferences > Settings
* On macOS - Code > Preferences > Settings

You are provided with a list of Default Settings. Copy any setting that you want to change to the appropriate settings.json file. The following are recommended (the SDK path will be different on your computer) - obviously the font size is whatever works best on your particular screen in your particular room with your particular audience:

```
{
   "window.zoomLevel": 0,
   "editor.fontSize": 24,
   "terminal.integrated.fontSize": 24,
   "ballerina.home": "/Users/DSotnikov/Ballerina/distro/"
}
```

**IMPORTANT**:

* It is highly recommended that you set **Auto Save** in VS Code. It is very easy to forget to save the file before building and then wonder why your code is not working as expected.

## Docker

## Twitter

The workshop is using Twitter account to send tweets.

If you want to re-use my demo account [https://twitter.com/B7aWorkshop](https://twitter.com/B7aWorkshop) - Please contact me I will give the corresponding twitter.toml config file.

Before starting your demo, delete all the old tweets - manually or by using **twitter_cleanup.bal** script that ships with the demo:

```
ballerina run twitter_cleanup.bal --config twitter.toml

curl -X DELETE localhost:9090/B7aDemo/0
```

For your own Twitter account:

1. Set up the account (need to have a verified phone number in order to be used programmatically),
2. Go to [https://apps.twitter.com/](https://apps.twitter.com/)
3. Click the **Create New App** button and provide the info: ![image alt text](img/image_5.png)
4. In the app, go to the **Keys and Access Tokens** tab:
![image alt text](img/image_6.png)
5. Generate keys and tokens if you have not done that so.
6. In your demo folder, create file **twitter.toml** and put the keys and tokens that you get from the twitter apps UI:

```
# Ballerina workshop demo config file
clientId = ""
clientSecret = ""
accessToken = ""
accessTokenSecret = ""
```
